## WoW Discord Bot

A Discord bot that can be used to query web services (WowHead, Blizzard, Raider.io, etc...) in chat.

**NOTE:** Since the Battle.Net API and Now deployment platform have both changed recently I am not sure how functional this is anymore.

I suggest using this at most as an outdated example and not as working software.


## Example

You type:
```
?gear redcat
```
or
```
?gear redcat saurfang us
```

Bot says:
```

No offhand equipped
```


## Motivation

All the other WoW Discord bots weren't suitable for the guild I was in at the time. Most other bots were "fun" or useless. I wanted a bot with simple commands and useful functions.


## Invite

No longer running.

~~You can invite the bot to your server by going here [https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=278336355057270784&scope=bot&permissions=0](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=278336355057270784&scope=bot&permissions=0)~~

> **Note:** You can only add a bot account to a server that you have Manage Server permissions on.



## Self-hosting

Or you can fork it, create your own API keys and host it for free like I am with Now.sh

* Create a [Now.sh account](https://zeit.co/now)
* Create a [Battle.net API Key](https://dev.battle.net/apps/mykeys)
    * You need the "Game API: Basic Plan Key"
* Create a [Discord App](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)
    * You need the "App Bot User Token"
* `npm install -g now`
* `now secrets add discord-api-key <discord-token-from-before>`
* `now secrets add bnet-api-key <bnet-api-key-from-before>`
* `now` (inside the project directory)


## Command Reference

* `?help` or `?commands`
    * Shows the command reference message
* `?loot`
    * Lists the rewards for doing mythic dungeons
* `?affixes` or `?affix`
    * Lists the weekly mythic dungeon affixes
* `?gear <character> [realm=saurfang] [region=us]`
    * Lists the gear for the provided character name, optional realm and region
* `?talents` or `?tals <character> [realm=saurfang] [region=us]`
    * Lists the talents for the provided character name, optional realm and region
* `?progression` or `?prog <character> [realm=saurfang] [region=us]`
    * Shows the raid progression for the provided character name, optional realm and region
    
**Note:** realm defaults to saurfang and region defaults to us.
